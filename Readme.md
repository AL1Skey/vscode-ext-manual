Copy extension Id(right click extension and click Copy extension Id)

ex:
ms-toolsai.jupyter

    ms-toolsai  :   publishers name
    jupyter     :   product name

Copy version number from extension description

ex:
v2023.5.1101742258
    
    v                       :   version
    2023.5.1101742258       :   version number

Why it's matter:
    Recently, vscode always annoy me with their 'XHR failed' feature everytime
    I want to install extension.
